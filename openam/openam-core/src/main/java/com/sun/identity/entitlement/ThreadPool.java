/**

 * This thread pool maintains a number of threads that run the tasks from a task
 * queue one by one. The tasks are handled in asynchronous mode, which means it
 * will not block the main thread to proceed while the task is being processed
 * by the thread pool.
 * <p>
 * This thread pool has a fixed size of threads. It maintains all the tasks to
 * be executed in a task queue. Each thread then in turn gets a task from the
 * queue to execute. If the tasks in the task queue reaches a certain number(the
 * threshold value), it will log an error message and ignore the new incoming
 * tasks until the number of un-executed tasks is less than the threshold value.
 * This guarantees the thread pool will not use up the system resources under
