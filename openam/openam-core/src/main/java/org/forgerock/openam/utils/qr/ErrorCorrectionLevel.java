/**
 * Represents the error correction level provided by a QR code. At present the four levels are
 *
 * LOW (Low)            7% of textual information can be restored
 * MEDIUM (Medium)      15% of textual information can be restored
 * QUARTILE (Quartile)  25% of textual information can be restored
 * HIGH (High)          30% of textual information can be restored
 *
 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code ยง "Error correction" for more information.
 *
 * Note: Given that the QR codes we are talking about here will be displayed on a digital device's screen, there is
 * unlikely to be a need for error correction at any level above the minimum ("LOW"). However if the QR code is to be
 * printed and is likely to be in an environment where it could be damaged, then the use of higher error correction
 * levels may be advisable.
 *
