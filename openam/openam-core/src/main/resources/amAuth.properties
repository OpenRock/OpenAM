to successfully authenticate to OpenAM.
a1301=Lockout Duration Multiplier
a1301.help=Value multiplied to the Login Failure Lockout Duration for each successive lockout.
a1301.help.txt=This property is used to enable OpenAM to increase the account lockout duration for each successive account lockout. \

instances of OpenAM in the same site to share information about a users invalid authentication attempts. By default the custom \
attribute; <code>sunAMAuthInvalidAttemptsData</code> defined in the <code>sunAMAuthAccountLockout</code> objectclass is used to \
store this data. Use this property to change the attribute used by OpenAM to store this information.<br/><br/>\

<ul><li>Account locked</li><li>Password changed</li></ul><br/>Custom code can also extend this mechanism.
a143.help.uri=#tbd
a144=Store Invalid Attempts in Data Store

itself to OpenAM before the client will be allow to use the remote authentication API to authenticate users. 
a147=User Attribute Mapping to Session Attribute
a147.help=Mapping of user profile attribute name to session attribute name.
a147.help.txt=The setting causes OpenAM to read the named attributes from the users profile in the data store and store their values \
in the users session.<br/></br>Format: User Profile Attribute|Session Attribute name. 
a148=Keep Post Process Objects for Logout Processing
a148.help=Store Post Processing Classes for the duration of the session.
a148.help.txt=Enabling this setting will cause OpenAM to store instances of post processing classes into the users session. \
When the user logs out the original instances of the post processing classes will be called instead of new instances. \
This may be needed for special logout processing.<br/><br/>\
<i>NB </i>Enabling this setting will increase the memory usage of OpenAM.
a149=Keep Authentication Module Objects for Logout Processing.
a149.help=The authentication modules instances will be stored in the users session.
a149.help.txt=Enabling this setting will cause OpenAM to store the authentication module instances used by the user to authenticate \
in the users session. Normally after authentication the module instances would be cleared. This may be needed for special logout \
processing.<br/><br/>\
<i>NB </i>Enabling this setting will increase the memory usage of OpenAM.
a150=Valid goto URL domains
a150.help=List of Valid goto URL domains
a150.help.txt=By default OpenAM will redirect the user to the URL specified in the goto parameter supplied to the authentication interface. \

a151.help=Keystore Alias for signing and encrypting RESTful Authentication requests.
a151.help.txt=This is the alias for the private/public keys in the Keystore used in RESTful authentication requests.

a152.help=Allows a user to authenticate using GET request parameters without showing the login screen.
a152.help.txt=Enable this feature if the authentication mechanism uses a single authentication screen or the first authentication screen should always be invisible to users (since it is auto-submitted). Use caution when enabling this feature as it can be used to authenticate using regular GET parameters, which could be cached by browsers and logged in server and proxy access logs exposing the values of the GET parameters.
a153=Persistent Cookie Authentication Level
a153.help=The authentication level for persistent cookie authentications
a153.help.txt=The authentication level set here will be used when persistent cookie is used for authentication.
a154=XUI interface
a154.help=Determines if XUI is the default interface for OpenAM
a154.help.txt=This setting determines if XUI is the default interface for OpenAM.  When enabled, OpenAM will redirect any requests to the /UI/* and idm/EndUser \
  pages to their respective XUI counterparts.  If disabled OpenAM will pass all requests to UI/* and the idm/EndUser pages to the classic UI like normal.
a155=Zero Page Login Referer Whitelist
a155.help=List of allowed HTTP Referer (sic) URLs from which Zero Page Login requests are allowed.
a155.help.txt=Enter here all URLs from which you want to allow Zero Page Login. This provides some mitigation against \
  Login CSRF attacks. Leave empty to allow from any Referer. Applies to both GET and POST login requests.
a156=Zero Page Login Allowed without Referer?
a156.help=Whether to allow Zero Page Login if the HTTP Referer header is missing.
a156.help.txt=The HTTP Referer header is sometimes missing from requests (e.g., if making a request to HTTP from \
  HTTPS). This setting controls whether such requests should be allowed or not. Setting to 'true' will reduce \
  the risk of Login CSRF attacks with Zero Page Login, but may potentially deny legitimate requests.
a157=Use Stateless Sessions?
a157.help=Enables stateless sessions for this realm.
a157.help.txt=Stateless sessions provide elastic scalability by storing all session state on the client in the SSO \
  cookie. See Session service configuration to enable signing and encryption (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED).

#Always the Authentication Level attribute should be the last item in the 
#display section of the profile page. Make sure the key is always a large
#number. Now it is a500. This is to avoid reshuffling the keys if new 
#attributes are added.

a500=Default Authentication Level
a500.help=The default authentication level for modules in this realm.
a500.help.txt=If the authentication module does not set it's own auth level then the module will have the default authentication level \
for the realm.
