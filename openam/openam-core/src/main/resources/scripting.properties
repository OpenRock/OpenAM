# Global engine configuration settings
ec100=Scripting engine configuration
ec101=Server-side Script Timeout
ec101.help=The maximum execution time any individual script should take on the server (in seconds).
ec101.help.txt=Server-side scripts will be forcibly stopped after this amount of execution time.
ec102=Core thread pool size
ec102.help=The core size of the thread pool from which scripts will operate.
ec103=Maximum thread pool size
ec103.help=The maximum size of the thread pool from which scripts will operate.
ec103.help.txt=New threads will be created up to this size once the task queue reaches capacity. Has no effect if the \
  queue is unbounded.
ec104=Thread pool queue size
ec104.help=Size of queue to use for buffering script execution request when core pool is at capacity.
ec104.help.txt=Use -1 for an unbounded queue (this disables the maximum pool size setting). For short, CPU-bound \
  scripts, consider a small pool size and larger queue length. For I/O-bound scripts (e.g., REST calls) consider \
  a larger maximum pool size and a smaller queue. Not hot-swappable: restart server for changes to take effect.
ec105=Thread idle timeout (seconds)
ec105.help=Length of time (in seconds) to wait before terminating threads.
ec105.help.txt=Length of time (in seconds) to wait before terminating threads that were started when the queue reached \
  capacity. Only applies to threads beyond the core pool size (up to the maximum size).
ec106=Java class whitelist
ec106.help=List of patterns of allowed Java classes that may be loaded/accessed by scripts.
ec106.help.txt=Each Java class accessed by a script must match at least one of these patterns. Use '*' as a wildcard, \
  e.g. <code>java.lang.*</code>
ec107=Java class blacklist
ec107.help=List of patterns of Java classes that must not be accessed by a script.
ec107.help.txt=This blacklist is applied after the whitelist to apply additional restrictions. For instance you may \
  whitelist java.lang.* and then blacklist java.lang.System and java.lang.Runtime. It is recommended to always prefer \
  specific whitelists where possible.
ec108=Use system SecurityManager
ec108.help=Indicates whether the system SecurityManager should also be consulted when checking access to Java classes.
ec108.help.txt=If enabled, then the checkPackageAccess method will be called for each Java class accessed. If no \
  SecurityManager is configured, then this has no effect.
