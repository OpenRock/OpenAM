 <title>Preface</title>
 
 <para>This guide shows you how to install core OpenAM services for access
 and federation management. Unless you are planning a throwaway evaluation
 or test installation, read the <citetitle>Release Notes</citetitle> before
 you get started.</para>

 <section>
  <title>Who Should Use this Guide</title>
  
  <para>This guide is written for anyone installing OpenAM to manage
  and to federate access to web applications and web based resources.</para>
   
  <para>This guide covers the install, upgrade, and removal (a.k.a. uninstall)
  procedures that you theoretically perform only once per version. This
  guide aims to provide you with at least some idea of what happens
  behind the scenes when you perform the steps.</para>
   
  <para>You do not need to be an OpenAM wizard to learn something from
  this guide, though a background in access management and maintaining
  web application software can help. You do need some background in
  managing services on your operating systems and in your application
  servers. You can nevertheless get started with this guide, and then
  learn more as you go along.</para>

  <title>Formatting Conventions</title>
  
  <note><para>Pay attention to notes like this one.</para></note>
  
  <para>Some items might be formatted differently from other text, like
  <filename>filenames</filename>, <command>commands</command>, and
  <literal>literal values</literal>.</para>
  
  <screen>$ echo Terminal sessions are formatted like this.
Terminal sessions are formatted like this.</screen>

  <programlisting language='java'>class Test

    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        System.out.println("This is a program listing.");

    }
}</programlisting>
  
  <para>In many cases, sections pertaining to UNIX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,
  and so forth are marked (UNIX). Sections pertaining to Microsoft Windows
  might be marked (Windows). To avoid repetition, however, file system
  directory names are often given only in UNIX format as in
  <filename>/path/to/OpenAM</filename>, even if the text applies to
  <filename>C:\path\to\OpenAM</filename> as well.</para>

  <title>Accessing OpenAM Documentation Online</title>
  
  <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
  be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
  documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Review+Process'
  >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
  review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
  with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>
  
  <!-- TODO: online location of core documentation, perhaps docs.forgerock.org? -->
  <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
  xlink:href='http://...'>...</link>.</para>
  
  <para>The <link xlink:href='http://wikis.forgerock.org/openam/'
  xlink:show="new">OpenAM Wiki</link> regularly brings you more, fresh content.
  In addition, you are welcome to <link xlink:show="new"
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you
  have something to share.</para>

  <title>Joining the OpenAM Community</title>
  
  <para>After you <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> at ForgeRock, you can also login to the Wiki and the issue
  database to follow what is happening with the project.</para>
  
  <para>If you have questions regarding OpenAM which are not answered by the
  documentation, there is a mailing list which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam</link> where you are
  likely to find an answer.</para>
  
  <para>The Wiki has information on how to check out OpenAM source code.
  There is also a mailing list for OpenAM development which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam-dev'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam-dev</link>
  Should you want to contribute a patch, test, or feature, or want to author
  part of the core documentation, first have a look on the ForgeRock site
  at <link xlink:href='http://www.forgerock.org/get_involved.html'>how to get
  involved</link>.</para>
