 <para>
  SAML v1.x describes an XML and SOAP based framework that allows
  online trusted partners to exchange security information.
  In particular, SAML v1.x defines mechanisms for
  browser based web single sign-on (SSO) across independent organizations
  that work together to permit SSO for access to resources.
 </para>

 <important>
  <para>
   Although not strictly compatible with SAML v1.x,
   SAML v2.0 extends SAML v1.x to several additional use cases
   and also clarifies how partners share metadata with each other.
   Unless you are integrating with an existing SAML v1.x deployment
   consider using SAML v2.0,
   or an alternative such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect 1.0, instead.

  <title>About SAML v1.x</title>

  <para>
   SAML v1.x was defined in response to several technical problems.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Web SSO solutions often use SSO session cookies.
     Browsers do not return cookies across domains.
     For instance, browsers do not return cookies
     set by servers in the example.com domain
     to servers in the example.net domain.
     SAML v1.x works around this limitation of HTTP cookies.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Before SAML v1.x was defined, there were already proprietary SSO solutions,
     but the solutions did not interoperate well across domains.
    </para>

    <para>
     SAML v1.x specifies a standard, cross-domain, interoperable SSO mechanism
     that works together with proprietary SSO services in a particular domain.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Before SAML v1.x was defined, there was not an easy way to communicate
     security attributes across organization boundaries.
    </para>

    <para>
     SAML v1.x simplifies the communication of security attributes
     between different organizations.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   In SAML v1.x, business partners can play two roles.
   The <firstterm>asserting party</firstterm>,
   also known as the SAML authority
   and whose domain is the Source site,
   authenticates users and asserts information about them.
   The <firstterm>relying party</firstterm>,
   whose domain is known as the Destination site,
   consumes assertions and uses information from the assertion
   to decide whether to allows access to resources.
  </para>

  <para>
   In the Web Browser SSO Profiles for SAML v1.x, the user generally starts
   by authenticating with the asserting party
   and then selecting a relying party link to browse.
   Alternatively, the "Destination-Site-First" scenario can start
   with the user browsing to the relying party's site
   and being redirected to the asserting party's site to authenticate.
  </para>

  <para>
   The SAML v1.x <firstterm>Inter-site Transfer Service</firstterm>
   is a service that redirects the authenticated user
   from the asserting party's site to the appropriate service
   on the relying party's site.
   The Inter-site Transfer Service also handles artifact and redirect generation.
   How this service transfers the user to the relying party's site depends on
   how the asserting party and the relying party exchange messages.
  </para>

  <para>
   The asserting party and relying party can exchange messages either
   by reference, where the asserting party sends
   an <firstterm>artifact</firstterm>
   (a base64 encoded reference to the assertion)
   as a query string parameter value,
   or by value, where the asserting party directs the user's browser
   to HTTP POST the assertion to the relying party.
  </para>

  <para>
   When the asserting party and relying party use artifacts,
   the Inter-site Transfer Service redirects
   the user's browser to the relying party's Artifact Receiver Service
   with the artifact as the value of a query string parameter.
   The relying party retrieves the artifact from the query string,
   and then sends a SAML Request
   to the Responder Service at the asserting party.
   The asserting party replies
   with a SAML Response containing one or more assertions.

   >SAML v1.1 technical overview</link> for more detail.
  </para>

  <para>
   When the assertion is sent using the Browser/POST Profile,
   the Inter-site Transfer Service responds to the user's browser
   with an auto-submitting form containing the SAML response.
   The browser then submits the SAML response as form data by HTTP POST
   to the relying party's Assertion Consumer Service.
   The relying party's Assertion Consumer Service then processes the assertion.

   >SAML v1.1 technical overview</link> for more detail.
  </para>

  <para>
   The Assertion Consumer Service at the relying party
   validates the digital signature on the SAML response,
   and redirects the browser to the target URL of the resource
   that the user is attempting to access.
   The server providing that resource uses
   the relying party's authorization decision capabilities to
   establish whether the user can access the resource.
   If so, the resource is returned to the user's browser.
   If the relying party is using OpenAM for example,
   then the relying party sets an OpenAM SSO token based on the SAML response,
   and this token is used to track the user's session for authorization.
  </para>

  <para>
   Organizations working together to achieve SAML v1.x web SSO
   are called <firstterm>trusted partners</firstterm> in this context.
   Trusted partners agree on which services they provide,
   which web SSO profiles they implement,
   and how information is exchanged in the assertions,
   including profile attribute values.
   Once the trusted partners have reached agreement on how they interact,
   you can collect information about your partners' configurations
   and configure OpenAM to match your organization's part of the agreement.

  <title>Preparing To Secure SAML v1.x Communications</title>

  <para>
   SAML communications are secured using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
   Communications should be protected over the network by HTTPS,
   and relying parties requesting assertions should use
   SSL or TLS mutual authentication to identify each other,
   meaning they should be able to trust each others' certificates.
   Furthermore, when an asserting party works through the user's browser
   to post an assertion to the relying party,
   then the asserting party must digitally sign the SAML response.
  </para>

  <para>
   A certificate can be trusted when the signer's certificate is trusted,
   or when the certificate itself is trusted.
   Trusted partners must either use public key certificates

     In the Common Settings section,
     set at least a name for the partner configuration,
     enter the partner's Site ID as the Source ID,
     and specify the fully qualified domain, optionally with the port number,
     of the relying party in the Target field.
     The value in the target field is matched to TARGET parameter values,
     so it should correspond to the real domain (and optionally port number)
     in the URLs of resources to access at the relying party's site.
    </para>

    <para>
     Optionally set a custom site attribute mapper,
     a custom name identifier mapper,
     and the SAML Version to use with the partner.
    </para>

    <para>
     You must also set one or more values in the host list for the partner
     to identify all hosts from the partner site that can send requests.
     OpenAM rejects SAML requests from hosts not specified in this list.

   <step>
    <para>
     In the Destination section,
     if the SAML Artifact profile is used with the relying party,

    </para>

    <para>
     If the SAML POST profile is used with the relying party,
     set the Post URL to the relying party's endpoint
     that consumes the assertion in the HTTP POST form data
     and redirects the user's browser to the target
     at the relying party's site.
    </para>

    <para>
     If the relying party makes SAML SOAP query requests,
     optionally set custom attribute or action mappers.
    </para>

    <para>
     If the relying party signs requests,
     then either requests include the certificate for the signing key
     in the KeyInfo element,
     or OpenAM must find the signing certificate elsewhere.
     If the relying party provides the signing certificate separately,
     import the signing certificate
     into OpenAM's <filename>keystore.jks</filename> file,
     and set the alias for the signing certificate here in the configuration.

    <para>
     If the asserting party signs assertions (or other messages)
     and you have imported the signing certificate

    <para>
     If the SOAP URL is accessed over HTTP, choose None or Basic.
     If the SOAP URL is accessed over HTTPS, choose SSL/TLS or SSL/TLS with Basic.

    <para>
     Basic means HTTP Basic authentication (with username and password).
     For HTTP Basic authentication,
     the authentication at this level is performed
     by the application server container, not OpenAM.
     Therefore if the asserting party runs OpenAM
     and wants to enforce HTTP Basic authentication,
     the asserting party administrator must set up the container
     to handle HTTP Basic authentication for the SOAP URL.
